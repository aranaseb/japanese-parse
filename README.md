# japanese-parse

japanese-parse is a segmentation, tagging, and parsing project for text in the Japanese language.
This language presents a unique NLP challenge as word boundaries are not as explicit as English.

# Status 5/9/2025
Basic segmentation has been implemented and rule-based tagging has been applied.
Plans for the future: find a larger dataset, and tag 'words' using machine learning instead of rules.
Some word boundaries are not currently detected (larger spans of kanji), and this will be addressed
